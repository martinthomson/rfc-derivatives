1.  Introduction

   The IETF produces RFCs to further its mission [RFC3935] of improving
   the Internet.  Intellectual property rights for these documents are
   held by the IETF Trust [BCP101].

   Previous advice to the IETF Trust [ADVICE] was that usage rights for
   IETF documents be limited to copying and translations.  This can have
   the effect of granting the IETF monopoly rights over the maintenance
   of work that is published in IETF documents.

   This document revises the advice to the IETF Trust given in RFC 5377
   to expand the rights granted in relation to IETF documents to include
   the ability to create derivative works.

   The IETF Trust, by way of its Trustees, has indicated that it will
   respect the wishes of the IETF in regard to the rights it will grant
   in relation to RFCs.  It is therefore the IETF's responsibility to
   articulate those wishes.

2.  Rationale

   The mission of the IETF [RFC3935] is to make the Internet better.
   This is primarily achieved by producing documents, RFCs, that define
   interoperable Internet protocols.  The IETF also publishes RFCs that
   further this mission in other ways, including Best Current Practice
   (BCP), Informational, and Experimental documents.

   Over time, the IETF has published documents on a very wide range of
   topics.  The quality of IETF publications depends on the ability for
   the IETF to find a sufficient number of participants with expertise
   in the topic area.

   The IETF has an excellent reputation as a venue for the
   standardization of Internet protocols.  The protocols and documents
   produced by the IETF are well respected.  The IETF enjoys strong
   ongoing support and so appears to be a good choice of venue for
   standardization in the areas in which the community has strong
   expertise.

   Should the IETF be unable to attract adequate depth of expertise to
   produce a revision of existing work, another organization might have
   that expertise.  In the most extreme case, the IETF could fail
   entirely or cease to be a viable venue for standardization, making it
   necessary to produce revisions in another venue.  Licensing that
   permits the creation of derivative works could allow another
   organization to perform necessary maintenance or revisions.

   The licensing terms generated in response to RFC 5377 [ADVICE] do not
   permit the creation of derivative works.  This could unduly give the
   IETF an monopoly over the maintenance of protocols that are published
   as IETF documents.

   While contributors are able to provide a license for this purpose,
   that depends on securing permission from all contributors.  The
   collaborative nature of IETF work makes it difficult to obtain this
   sort of license.  In many cases it may not even be practical to
   determine all the contributors and contact them.  The IETF Trust is
   in a position to make more permissive terms more readily available
   for all new documents.

   Similar considerations apply to other document streams: IAB, IRTF, or
   independent submissions [RFC4844]; however, see Section 4.

3.  Permitting the Creation of Derivative Works

   This document advises the IETF Trust to amend the license for IETF
   Documents (RFCs and Internet-Drafts) [LICENSE] to permit the creation
   of derivative works.

   This is in addition to the rights granted under the existing license
   [LICENSE].

3.1.  Recognition of Status

   The IETF Trust is requested to ensure that any license permitting the
   creation of a derivative work stipulates that the original work be
   clearly identified.  Derivatives also need to clearly attribute
   authors and contributors of the original.

3.2.  Withholding of Naming Rights

   The IETF Trust is advised to make the license to create derivative
   works conditional on the use of a distinct protocol name when
   creating new versions of existing protocols.  This need not apply to
   reused or copied protocol elements or fields; it only applies to the
   protocol, extension, or component that is being revised.

   The IETF Trust should maintain the ability to permit the reuse of a
   name in appropriate cases, such as when the IETF agrees to transfer
   development of a protocol to a different organization or where the
   IETF has decided not to take up a given piece of work and the
   proponents bring it elsewhere.

   The potential for confusion about the status of a derivative work is
   not completely avoidable.  However, the requirement to use a new name
   for protocols or mechanisms ensures that names are not used to
   compound any potential confusion.

4.  Other Streams

   The IETF Trust is also responsible for licensing terms on documents
   that are produced in relation to the activity of other RFC streams
   (IRTF, IAB, and independent).  The IETF cannot advise the IETF Trust
   as it relates to licenses on RFCs published in these other streams.

   Ideally, other streams would adopt the amended license terms, as they
   have done for the existing license [LICENSE].  That would ensure
   consistency across the RFC series and for work contributed to other
   streams.  However, this document cannot serve as advice from other
   streams; it can only capture IETF consensus.

5.  Older RFCs

   As noted in [LICENSE], IETF documents published prior to the
   effective date of that license are subject to other licensing
   provisions.  The IETF Trust is not requested to attempt to secure the
   ability to alter the license terms for these documents.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document is purely procedural in nature and therefore raises no
   new concerns that might affect the security of Internet users.
   However, ensuring that proper protocol maintenance can be conducted
   by qualified and motivated experts could improve security.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
